# High Issues

## H-1: Functions send eth away from contract but performs no checks on any address.

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

	```solidity
	    function refund() external nonReentrant beforeDeadline {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	        _to.transfer(refundValue);
	```

</details>



## L-2: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/ChristmasDinner.sol [Line: 170](src/ChristmasDinner.sol#L170)

	```solidity
	        host = _newHost;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## L-4: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function



<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	    modifier nonReentrant() {
	```

</details>



## L-5: State variable could be declared constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.

	```solidity
	    bool public deadlineSet = false;

## L-6: State variable changes but no event is emitted.

State variable changes in this function but no event is emitted.
